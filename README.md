Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The gaming room was a company looking to serve multiple platforms based on their current Android app game called “Draw it or Lose it”.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I did a solid job of explaining the deiiferent capabilities of each server operating system and making a recomendation based on the needs of the client.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found making the UML document most helpful because it gave me a nice skelton to work off of, allowing to me visualize my software and how it will intereact all before a single line of code was written.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise my initial evaluation, making more thorough and include a few additonal pieces of information.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted it by evaluating what the want to do with their software and how to best go about it. Its important to consider the needs of the client because you are essentially working for them and their idea may not be perfectly flushed out, we should stay inline with the expectations.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached it by utilizing many different techniqes, such as singletons and creating a UML document to keep me organized.
